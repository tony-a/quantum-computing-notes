## Coding exercises following lecture notes from this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/quantum-computing-in-python-using-qiskit/) on quantum computing.

## Setup:
Using anaconda-navigator launch Jupyter notebook after having installed the following two libraries, and then navigate to the folder containing the Jupyter notebooks using the UI.

- pip install qiskit
- pip install pylatexenc


## Material:

### Section 5:
Exercises highlighting different quantum gates acting on the ground state, |0⟩, and the excited state, |1⟩.

### Section 7:
Demonstrating how to construct various gates (such as Identity, Hadamard, and Pauli gates) using the most general single qubit gate formula.
