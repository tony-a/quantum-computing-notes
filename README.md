Notes on Quantum computing

# Learning materials:

## To learn the CS and Math side of quantum computing:
[hour and half](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Riqjdh2oM), requires some basic background of linear algebra. 

## To learn the programming side of quantum computing:
[playlist of 9 vides, about 15 minutes each](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-Vvp2xg9-POLJhQwtVktlYGbY). Using Qiskit, a python library, doesn't require understanding of quantum mechanics.

## Quantum gates:
Understanding how to preform operations on qubits.
[10 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz5rjhiU4ao)


## Quantum Decoherence
Why does it take so long for us to increase the number of qubits in a circuit?

Why can't we slap more curcuits together?
