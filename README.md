# Notes on Quantum Computing:

A collection of videos and lectures I've found to be helpful on the theory and application of Quantum Computing.
Most cover the concepts at a high level in laymen terms.

- Quantum computing takes advantage of two quantum phenomena that we don't observe at the macro scale.
   - **Superposition** - The ability for a particle to be in a linear combination of it's basis states.

   - **Entanglement**- When a property of a particle (such as spin, polarization or momentum) is coupled with a counter particle, such that the state of one cannot be described without taking into account the state of the other.

- Qubits:
Several quantum particles can be used as a qubit:
  - [The outer electron of a phosphors atom.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNzzGgr2mhk)
  - [The polarization property of a photon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofg335d3BJ8).

- Quantum volume: A measure to benchmark computers that take into consideration the number of qubits, along with the number of gates and measurement errors, device cross talk, as well as device connectivity and circuit compiler efficiency.

### Additional learning materials and resources:

- To learn the theory and Math side of quantum computing:
[Hour and half video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Riqjdh2oM), requires some basic background of linear algebra.


- To learn the programming side of quantum computing:
[Playlist of 9 videos, about 15 minutes each](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-Vvp2xg9-POLJhQwtVktlYGbY). Using Qiskit, a python library, doesn't require understanding of quantum mechanics.
