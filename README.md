# QC notes

Quantum computing takes advantage of two quantum phenomena that we don't observe at the macro scale. The two phenomena being:
- **Superposition** - The ability of a particle to switch itself from one state to another, following some knowable probabilistic distribution.

- **Entanglement** - When a property of a particle (such as spin, polarization or momentum) is coupled with a counter particle, such that the state of one cannot be described without taking into account the state of the other.

Preformance:
Measuring the preformance of a quantum computer, is dependent on multiple aspects:
1. Number of qubits in the system: 
2. Quantum volume, a new measuring-concept recently introduced by IBM that takes into consideration the number of qubits along with their noise level to come.


# Learning materials:

## To learn the CS and Math side of quantum computing:
[Hour and half video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Riqjdh2oM), requires some basic background of linear algebra. 

## To learn the programming side of quantum computing:
[Playlist of 9 vides, about 15 minutes each](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-Vvp2xg9-POLJhQwtVktlYGbY). Using Qiskit, a python library, doesn't require understanding of quantum mechanics.

# Qubits:

## Quantum gates:
Understanding how to preform operations on qubits.

## Quantum Decoherence
Why does it take so long for us to increase the number of qubits in a circuit?

Why can't we slap more curcuits together?
